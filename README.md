Want to track the time your members spend on your Discord server?
Then look no further.
With this Discord bot, you can track the talking time and the sent messages with an included leveling system.
To see the users stat's, the bot provides an interactive leaderboard, which you can sort by different aspects.
Also, the bot provides many other features, to handle operations for your server: Giving roles via reactions, make polls, dynamic voicechannels, â€¦

## Requirements
You need Python Version 3.6 or newer. 
The requirements must be installed via `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.  
That's it.

## Installation
Run `git clone https://github.com/PantomInach/DataBot.git` in your installation folder or download the repository manually.

## Create a bot
Create a [Discord Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) on the site [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
Make sure "Presence Intent", "Server Members Intent" and "Message Content Intent" are enabled in Privileged Gateway Intents under the Bot tab.
Then copy the token to the specified space in the data/config.json file.
More to the config file in [Configuration](#Configuration).
Also add your guild in the "server" space and your Discord ID in "owner".
Now you need to invite the Bot to your guild.
Use https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=INSERT_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=2416143440 after replacing "INSERT_CLIENT_ID_HERE" with your Bots client ID under the tab OAuth2.
The bot is now created and invited to your server.
