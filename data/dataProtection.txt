**Note on data processing (A00002b)**
```This Discord-Server uses a self-programmed bot, based on Discords own API, to collect and process user data.
The bot shown as "PantomDataBot#3363" ("z +level" in member list) tracks the following:
-    Number of written messages in every text-channel
-    Length of written messages in every text-channel
-    Giving of reactions to written messages in every text-channel
-    Number of active users and active UserID in every voice-channel
-    Mute-status of every active user in every voice-channel
-    Camera- and LIVE-status of every active user in every voice-channel
-    Every reaction to bot-messages in every text-channel for bot-interaction
-    Time of user-messages in every text-channel
-    User-Messages with "+" prefix in every text-channel
-    Time of given user-roles
-    Time of gained experience-points for being active in voice-channels
-    Every direct-message you send the bot “PantomDataBot#3363“

The Bot shown as "PantomDataBot#3363" ("z +level" in member list) DOES NOT track the following:
-    Content of written user-messages in every text-channel without "+" prefix
-    Content of given reactions to any written user-messages in every text-channel
-    Any content of transferred voice or video in voice-channels

All named aspects are part of server-own features like getting roles by pressing bot-reactions, banning users in text-channels and gaining roles by leveling. Data is stored and processed combined with Discords User-ID and won’t be hand out to third parties.
The text-channel “level” features a leaderboard with the usernames and their hours spend on the server, the number of their written messages as well as the amount of gained experience-points by doing it.
By leaving the server, all user-related data will be deleted from the server after 14 days without rejoining.

By clicking on the bot-reaction you accept the named aspects above.
Have fun on our server,
your admins and mods```
